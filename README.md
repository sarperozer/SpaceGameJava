This is the Term Project for my Object Orientied Programming course. In this project I created a Space Shooter game with OOP using Java GUI elements.

Core game mechanic is shooting aliens with a spaceship without running out of health. There are 3 types of aliens, different laser types and all have separate classes. Game includes a high-score system. So, first you need to register and login. User name, password and score stored in USER_DATA.txt file. Game also contains sound effects and a Game Over screen. Game loop structure can be found in GamePanel class.
